** cartoon of discrete trait evolution (after slide 4)
* improve 'data on all traits' plot (better labels, larger)
* improved flow diagram, find final version from paper
* improve pruning algorithm (make pix the same size; highlight new values?)
* improve LRT example (larger!)

MISSING: BayesTraits posteriors, 'possible approaches', contrast matrix, results

* more on BayesTraits priors and posteriors?

* picture of correlated traits on a phylogeny?
* improve LRT figure
* links to talk etc.?
