* cartoon of discrete trait evolution (after slide 4)
* table of data completeness (Venn diagram?)
* improve pruning algorithm pix (make pix the same size; highlight new values?)
* animate AIC table? (gray/reveal columns)
* trace plot?
* autodiff comparisons! timing on optimization, HMC
* scrolling/block size, for contrast matrix?
* rename models in sensitivity analysis plot
* people pictures? (Sigal?)

## done (at least partly)

* improve 'data on all traits' plot (better labels, larger)
