Biologists often want to understand why certain traits of organisms
evolved. One way of translating this question into a statistical
context is to set up a continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process
along the branches of a phylogenetic tree and estimate how the
evolutionary rates (log-hazards of changes in particular states) vary
depending on the current values of other traits. Using an example from
fish biology I will explain how to estimate the log-likelihood of a
set of tip states given a transition matrix; based on this computation
we can use standard Bayesian (Markov chain Monte Carlo) techniques to estimate linear contrasts that
describe the effects of one biological trait on the evolutionary rate
of another trait. I will also (1) rant briefly about some
philosophical issues, in particular why single, scalar metrics
describing model performance (in this case, p-values, but applicable
to other metrics from statistics and machine learning) are less useful than interval measures of uncertainty
(2) discuss ongoing technical improvements using automatic
differentiation to enable Hamilton Monte Carlo sampling.
