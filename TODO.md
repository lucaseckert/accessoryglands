## missing data

missing data, mostly for parental care/mating system traits (AG info is known)

- maximum fallback: forget it all, go back to BayesTools
- or: run pairwise analyses in augmented corHMM (i.e. get confidence intervals etc.)
- or: single-trait single imputation (continuous hack via phytools or invent something. Use ancestral character estimation/mapping to MRCA of known and unknown taxa/trait combos
- or: multiple imputation? ugh
- or: see if we can roll an 'unknown state' and/or unobserved values into the machinery

## tree blocks/uncertainty

- consensus tree from tree block?
- use complete tree?

## 

- think about multimodal likelihood surface
   - MCMC algorithms
   - multiple chains?
   - run lots longer?
   - thin?
   
- gain/loss polarity

## next steps

- clear picture of ideal program
- figure out how to parameterize interactions
- compare monkey/Pagel & Meade?
- power differences?
- biologically
