	abstract = {We describe a Bayesian method for investigating correlated evolution of discrete binary traits on phylogenetic trees. The method ﬁts a continuous-time Markov model to a pair of traits, seeking the best ﬁtting models that describe their joint evolution on a phylogeny. We employ the methodology of reversible-jump (RJ) Markov chain Monte Carlo to search among the large number of possible models, some of which conform to independent evolution of the two traits, others to correlated evolution. The RJ Markov chain visits these models in proportion to their posterior probabilities, thereby directly estimating the support for the hypothesis of correlated evolution. In addition, the RJ Markov chain simultaneously estimates the posterior distributions of the rate parameters of the model of trait evolution. These posterior distributions can be used to test among alternative evolutionary scenarios to explain the observed data. All results are integrated over a sample of phylogenetic trees to account for phylogenetic uncertainty. We implement the method in a program called RJ Discrete and illustrate it by analyzing the question of whether mating system and advertisement of estrus by females have coevolved in the Old World monkeys and great apes.},

	abstract = {Biologists now have the capability of building large phylogenetic trees consisting of tens of thousands of species, from which important comparative questions can be addressed. However, to the extent that biologists have applied these large trees to comparative data, it is clear that current methods, such as those that deal with the evolution of binary morphological characters, make unrealistic assumptions about how these characters are modeled. As phylogenies increase both in size and scope, it is likely that the lability of a binary character will differ significantly among lineages. In this chapter, we describe how a new generalized model, which we refer to as the “hidden rates model” (HRM), can be used to identify different rates of evolution in a discrete binary character along different branches of a phylogeny. The HRM is part of a class of models that are more broadly known as Hidden Markov models because it presupposes that unobserved “hidden” rate classes underlie each observed state and that each rate class represents potentially different transition rates to and from these observed states. As we discuss, the recognition and accommodation of this heterogeneity can provide a robust picture of binary character evolution.},

	abstract = {The growth of phylogenetic trees in scope and in size is promising from the standpoint of understanding a wide variety of evolutionary patterns and processes. With trees comprised of larger, older, and globally distributed clades, it is likely that the lability of a binary character will differ significantly among lineages, which could lead to errors in estimating transition rates and the associated inference of ancestral states. Here we develop and implement a new method for identifying different rates of evolution in a binary character along different branches of a phylogeny. We illustrate this approach by exploring the evolution of growth habit in Campanulidae, a flowering plant clade containing some 35,000 species. The distribution of woody versus herbaceous species calls into question the use of traditional models of binary character evolution. The recognition and accommodation of changes in the rate of growth form evolution in different lineages demonstrates, for the first time, a robust picture of growth form evolution across a very large, very old, and very widespread flowering plant clade.

	abstract = {Highlights • Bayesian methods are widely used for data-poor stock assessment models. • Four case-studies and a simulation experiment show that Bayesian data-poor assessments can be highly sensitive to unjustified decisions about priors. • Specifically, the arbitrary upper bound on a uniform prior on log-maximum recruitment determines results in 3 of 4 case studies. • Potential solutions involve placing informative priors on other parameters or quantities. • Reviewers should avoid prescribing Bayesian methods for data-poor models, for cases when these four solutions are inappropriate. Abstract A Bayesian approach to parameter estimation in fisheries stock assessment is often preferred over maximum likelihood estimates, and fisheries management guidelines also sometimes specify that one or the other paradigm be used. However, important issues remain unresolved for the Bayesian approach to stock assessment despite over 25 years of research, development, and application. Here, we explore the consequence of a common practice in Bayesian assessment models: assigning a uniform prior to the logarithm of the parameter representing population scale (log-carrying capacity for biomass-dynamics models, or log-unfished recruits for age-structured models). First, we explain why the value chosen for the upper bound of this prior will affect parameter estimates and fisheries management advice given two properties that are met for many data-poor stock assessment models. Next, we use three case studies and a simulation experiment to show a substantial impact of this decision for data-limited assessments off the US West Coast. We end by discussing four methods for generating an informative prior on the population scale parameter, but conclude that these will not be suitable for many assessments. In these cases, we advocate that maximum likelihood estimation is a simple way to avoid the use of Bayesian priors that are excessively informative.},

	abstract = {We implement a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for estimating species divergence times that uses heterogeneous data from multiple gene loci and accommodates multiple fossil calibration nodes. A birth-death process with species sampling is used to specify a prior for divergence times, which allows easy assessment of the effects of that prior on posterior time estimates. We propose a new approach for specifying calibration points on the phylogeny, which allows the use of arbitrary and flexible statistical distributions to describe uncertainties in fossil dates. In particular, we use soft bounds, so that the probability that the true divergence time is outside the bounds is small but nonzero. A strict molecular clock is assumed in the current implementation, although this assumption may be relaxed. We apply our new algorithm to two data sets concerning divergences of several primate species, to examine the effects of the substitution model and of the prior for divergence times on Bayesian time estimation. We also conduct computer simulation to examine the differences between soft and hard bounds. We demonstrate that divergence time estimation is intrinsically hampered by uncertainties in fossil calibrations, and the error in Bayesian time estimates will not go to zero with increased amounts of sequence data. Our analyses of both real and simulated data demonstrate potentially large differences between divergence time estimates obtained using soft versus hard bounds and a general superiority of soft bounds. Our main findings are as follows. (1) When the fossils are consistent with each other and with the molecular data, and the posterior time estimates are well within the prior bounds, soft and hard bounds produce similar results. (2) When the fossils are in conflict with each other or with the molecules, soft and hard bounds behave very differently; soft bounds allow sequence data to correct poor calibrations, while poor hard bounds are impossible to overcome by any amount of data. (3) Soft bounds eliminate the need for “safe” but unrealistically high upper bounds, which may bias posterior time estimates. (4) Soft bounds allow more reliable assessment of estimation errors, while hard bounds generate misleadingly high precisions when fossils and molecules are in conflict.},
