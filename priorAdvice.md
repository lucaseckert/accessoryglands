## Synthesis of Advice on Priors

Jess' advice was since retracted after further explaination. Sigal's advice fits into John's so basically John's advice should cover it and is as follows:

for SC: loss 5X faster than gain - gain 10X faster than loss
for AG: loss 100-1000X faster than gain - gain 10X faster than loss
