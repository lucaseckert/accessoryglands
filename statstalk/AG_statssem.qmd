# The evolutionary problem

## Correlated traits

* How do we analyze correlations in structured data?
* ... specifically, **phylogenetic** data?
* correlations between **organismal traits**
* ... specifically, *discrete* traits

## accessory glands

* glands associated with seminal fluid  
(in humans, flies, other insects ...)
* often associated with **sperm competition**
* in fish, may also be associated with **male parental care**

## examples

## data

![](../pix/fish_ag_phylo.png)

## associated traits

* **pair** vs. **group spawning** (proxy for sperm competition)
* presence of **male parental care**

## all data

![](../pix/phylo_plot-1.png)

# From evolution to statistics

## modeling correlated evolution

* model the influence of a trait on the *rate of change* of another trait [@pagelDetecting1997]
   * is the rate of gain/loss of AGs (in)dependent of whether a species (lineage) has group vs pair spawning, or male parental care?
* likelihood ratio tests for (in)equality of rates

## setting up the model

* continuous-time, discrete-state Markov process
* pairwise **hazards** 
$$
h_{ij}  = \lim_{\Delta t \to 0} P(i \to j\:\textrm{between}\:t\:\textrm{and}\:t+\Delta t)
$$

## flow diagram

![](../pix/flowfig.png)

## computing the likelihoods

* create a **rate matrix** $\Q$ with $Q_{ij} = h_{ij}$ ($i \neq j$), $Q_{ii} = -\sum_{i\neq j} h_{ij}$
* probability along a branch: **matrix exponential**
   * i.e. given rate matrix $\Q$, transition probabilities over time $\Delta t$ are $\exp(\Q \Delta t)$
* combining probabilities for the whole tree: ??

## pruning algorithm [@felsensteinMaximum1973]

* conditional independence of graph nodes given value at an intervening node
* recursive computation starting from tips
* at tips, probability is 1 for observed trait, 0 for others  
(or evenly distributed across unknown traits)

$$
\begin{split}
& \pr(k\:\textrm{at parent}) \\
& \quad = \pr(k\:\textrm{at parent}|\textrm{data at child 1}) \times \\
& \qquad \quad \pr(k\:\textrm{at parent}|\textrm{data at child 2}) \\
& \quad = \sum \left( \pr(k\to i) \cdot \pr(i \textrm{ at child 1})\right) \times \\
& \qquad \quad \sum \left( \pr(k \to i) \cdot \pr(i \textrm{ at child 2})\right)
\end{split}
$$

## pruning algorithm (complete)

* once we get to the **root**, compute $\sum \textrm{Prior(i)} \cdot \pr(i)$
* now apply your favourite optimization algorithm ...


## LRTs

* code from `corHMM` package [@corHMM; @beaulieu_hidden_2014]

(picture of LRT)

# pause for statistical philosophy

## can we do better inference?

* pairwise comparisons are unsatisfying
* could rank by AIC/BIC/etc. ...

(AIC etc. table)

## BayesTraits

* what about a Bayesian solution?
* (describe)

## BayesTraits example [@pagel_bayesian_2006]

## table of approaches

## an approach to a quantitative solution

* **how much** do traits affect rates?

## contrasts (repeat flow figure)

## contrast matrix

# what we ended up with

* assume independence of spawning, parental care transitions  
(24 $\to$ 12 distinct rates)
* compute log-likelihoods by methods described above
* decide on priors
* Metropolis-Hastings sampling with adaptive MVN candidate distribution
* random sampling over **tree block** (imputed phylogeny)

## priors

* for regularization
* informative but neutral
* set "reasonable" lower/upper bounds for rates
* assume log-Normal prior, with lower/upper bounds representing $\mu \pm 3 \sigma$
* priors on gain/loss ratio
* examine **prior predictive samples** (McElreath)

## MCMC diagnostics/params

* 8 chains, 84000 iterations, burn-in of 4000, thin by 10 (640,000 samples)
* 12-24 hours on 8 cores
* (improved) R-hat statistics all $\leq 1.01$, effective sample sizes all $>1000$ [@lambertRobust2022]
* trace plots
* pairs plots

## pairs plots ex.


## results

## sensitivity analyses

* full 24-parameter model
* known phylogeny only
* drop gain/loss priors
* MLE fit
* MLE fit, additive model
* MAP fit with priors

## sensitivity analyses (pic)

## to-do list

* compute Bayes factors (bridge sampling)
* re-implement with HMC sampling in Template Model Builder (C++/autodiff engine) [@TMB2016]
* consider contrasts weighted by occupancy?
* extensions to hidden Markov models/covarion model [@beaulieu_hidden_2014]
